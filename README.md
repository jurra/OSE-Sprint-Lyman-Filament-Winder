# OSE-Sprint-Lyman-Filament-Winder
Documentation of the Lyman Filament Winder for Open Source Ecology replication workshops.

# Important point to make regarding Github usage and the proposition for OSE:
Github will speedup the process of uploading, avoiding to upload manually each file we create, instead we create them in a replicated repository that can be easily updated. This Sprint should be seen as a test to improve our workflow; we are experimenting also with our team pushing the boundaries to get more agile. It is a way to evaluate if Github is a good plattform for us as it is for software.


# Intro to github (2 minutes)
Please see the [github workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GO1a1vgNrc&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp) to understand how it works.

# Open Source workflow (2 minutes)
See the video for [open source workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VY0kHqIqyU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp) and how local storage is integrated on the workflow in a natural way without having to manually upload each file to the wiki. The repository structure that we have locally will be the same as shown on the web.

# Steps for Preparation:

1. Everybody should have (create) a github account.
2. Add the collaborators of Open Source, to avoid forking allowing collaborators from the OSE to make commits directly in the master branch.
3. Download github desktop and 
4.clone the this repository to your github desktop. [If not familiarized see this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2W7igZqHgA&ab_channel=SeleneSchmittling).

Once this is done we should be ready to commit changes and update the masterbranch avoiding the tedious steps of uploading manually each file. The best idea would be to do branches for parts, in order to avoid problems with the master branch.

Comments are welcome since there are more experienced people in the team with github.
